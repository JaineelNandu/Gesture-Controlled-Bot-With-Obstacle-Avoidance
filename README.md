# Gesture-Controlled-Bot-With-Obstacle-Avoidance
- Realized a gesture controller mechanism that makes a bot move in with respect to the angle of the palm in the coordinate axes. - Implemented I2C communication of MPU 6050 3 axis accelerometer &amp; ATMega328P microcontroller to recognise simple gestures. - Controlled 2x12VDC motors with PWM commands from the microcontroller to L293D H-Bridge controller
